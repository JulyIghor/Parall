## About Parall

**Parall** lets you create separate app shortcuts that launch new, independent instances of your existing macOS apps - all without modifying system files or the original app.

Each shortcut is a self-contained `.app` bundle that appears as a separate icon in your Dock.  
You can use Parall to run multiple copies of browsers, productivity apps, or any other app - with unique settings, arguments, or profiles.

## Key Features

- **Multiple App Instances** - Run apps side-by-side as if they were different applications.
- **Dock Shortcuts** - Each shortcut appears as its own icon in the Dock and can be pinned.
- **Automatic Updates** - Shortcuts stay in sync when the original app updates.
- **Custom Command Line Arguments** - Configure per-shortcut options for power users.
- **Optional Data Storage Separation** - Supported for Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.).
- **Fully Offline & Private** - Parall never connects to the Internet or sends data anywhere.
- **No Background Services** - Nothing runs when you close it.
- **No System Modifications** - Works entirely within the user space - no scripts, no hacks.

---

## Supported Apps

- Works with **most macOS apps**.
- Built-in data storage isolation for **Chromium-based browsers**.
- Other apps can still use custom arguments for manual profile or data path separation.
- **Note:** macOS and Apple-provided apps (bundle IDs starting with `com.apple.`) are not supported.

---

## Technical Notes

- The shortcuts Parall creates are **unsigned** and **not sandboxed** - by design.  
  They directly launch the target app's executable, so macOS may show a security prompt the first time you run them.
- Parall and its shortcuts **do not modify any files or applications**.
- Parall is **fully sandboxed**, **works offline**, and **never sends any data**.
